<section id="challenges">
    <h2>Technological Challenges</h2>
    <p>Examine the scalability issues, energy consumption, and the need for regulatory frameworks.Blockchain technology faces significant challenges, including scalability issues that limit transaction speeds and energy consumption concerns, particularly with Proof of Work (PoW) systems. Additionally, regulatory uncertainty across jurisdictions creates hurdles for widespread adoption, and security risks, such as 51% attacks and smart contract vulnerabilities, pose ongoing threats to its integrity and reliability. Handling a high number of transactions per second remains a challenge, as blockchains often suffer from slower transaction speeds compared to tradition.Blockchain technology faces significant challenges, including scalability issues that limit transaction speeds and energy consumption concerns, particularly with Proof of Work (PoW) systems.
